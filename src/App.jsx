meri jaan,
Today is not just your birthday, it‚Äôs a divine day for me ‚Äî the day Bhagwan sent his most precious blessing into this world, YOU üôèüí´.
You are my love, my life, my zindagi. You are the aarti ü™î that lights up my heart, the shakti that keeps me strong, and the prarthana that I never stop whispering to the universe.
Every morning when I open my eyes, I thank Mahadev üïâ for giving me someone as pure and beautiful as you. You are my sunshine ‚òÄ in the darkest clouds, my mandir ki ghanti that fills my soul with peace, and my endless mohabbat.
On your janamdin, I bow in prayer ü§≤ ‚Äî may Bhagwan always protect you, bless you with health, wisdom, and all the happiness of this universe. May your life be as radiant as Diwali diyas ü™î, as pure as Ganga jal, and as strong as Shiv ji‚Äôs trishul.
You are my soulmate, my karmic bond, my ardhangini  written by destiny itself. With you, I feel I have found my own little Vaikunth, my own Kailash.
I promise to always stand by you like Ram stood by Sita, like Shiv stood by Parvati, like Krishna stood by Radha. In every yug, in every janam, my soul will keep finding you ‚Äî because you are not just my today, you are my anant prem.
So on this sacred day of your birth üå∏, I just want to tell you‚Ä¶
You are my prayer answered, my dream fulfilled, my life‚Äôs most divine gift.
Happy Birthday once again, meri zindagi ü§ç.
You are my blessing, my aashirvaad, my eternal love.
